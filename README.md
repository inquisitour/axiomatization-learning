This repository contains an interactive dashboard for the paper "Teaching Transformers Causal Reasoning through Axiomatic Training" by Vashishtha et al. (2024). Explore key findings on how transformers learn causal axioms, generalize to complex structures, and compare with large language models.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Sections**: Navigate through Introduction, Methodology, Experiments, Results, and more.
- **Visualizations**: Explore graphs and charts illustrating key findings.
- **Comparative Analysis**: See how axiomatic training compares to large language models.
- **Causal Axioms**: Deep dive into the transitivity axiom and its applications.
